# DevBites — Continuation Status

## This session: Production-readiness hardening (COMPLETE)

The codebase was found to already be feature-complete (all prior sessions'
wishlist items #1–#7 done). This session focused on security/production
hardening since none was previously addressed:

1. **Open redirect fix** — `blueprints/auth.py` login's `?next=` param was
   passed straight to `redirect()`. Added `_is_safe_redirect_url()` (only
   allows same-site relative paths) and used it before redirecting.
2. **Quiz XP-farming fix** — `submit_quiz()` in `blueprints/main.py` awarded
   XP on every resubmission. Now only the user's first attempt on a given
   bite awards XP (`is_first_attempt` check against existing `QuizAttempt`
   rows); subsequent attempts still record score/results but flag
   `xp_awarded: false` in the JSON response. `static/js/bite.js` shows a
   note when XP wasn't re-awarded.
3. **Backend validation hardening** — `auth.py` registration now validates
   email with a proper regex (`EMAIL_RE`) instead of `"@" in email`, and
   restricts usernames to a safe charset (`USERNAME_RE`).
4. **Production config** — `config.py`: auto-loads `.env` via
   `python-dotenv` (was listed in requirements but never invoked); added
   `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY/SAMESITE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` (env-gated),
   `REMEMBER_COOKIE_*` equivalents, `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` cap;
   `ProductionConfig` forces secure cookies on.
5. **`app.py`** — refuses to boot in `production` config with the default
   `SECRET_KEY`; applies `ProxyFix` in production for correct
   scheme/host/IP behind a reverse proxy; adds rotating file logging
   (`logs/devbites.log`, WARNING+) when running in production without
   debug; adds a `after_request` hook setting
   `X-Content-Type-Options`/`X-Frame-Options`/`Referrer-Policy` (+ HSTS
   when cookies are secure); `__main__` block now respects `app.config["DEBUG"]`
   and `PORT` env var instead of hardcoded `debug=True`/port 5000.
6. **New deployment files** — `wsgi.py` (forces production config,
   gunicorn-ready entrypoint) and `Procfile`
   (`web: gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT wsgi:app`). `gunicorn` added to
   `requirements.txt`.
7. **README** — new "Production Deployment" section documenting all of the
   above.

### Note on test execution
This sandbox session had no network egress and Flask-SQLAlchemy /
Flask-Login / Flask-WTF / PyMySQL were not pre-installed, so the test suite
could not be executed here (same limitation noted in the prior session).
All touched files were verified with `python -m py_compile` (no errors).
The quiz XP-farming fix was cross-checked against
`tests/test_bites_and_quizzes.py` — no existing test resubmits a quiz, so
behavior of all existing tests is unaffected.

## Completed features overall
Auth, bites, quizzes, gamification (incl. XP history log + admin view),
recommendations, certificates, fake payments, analytics dashboard, admin
panel (with XP log), leaderboard, error pages, full pytest suite, CSRF
protection, admin pagination/search, UI polish, recommendation-engine perf
fixes + DB indexes, expanded README, mark-incomplete UX, client-side email
validation, open-redirect fix, quiz XP-farming fix, production
deployment hardening (secure cookies, security headers, ProxyFix, logging,
gunicorn/wsgi/Procfile, .env auto-load, SECRET_KEY enforcement).

## Status
Feature-complete and hardened for production deployment. No known bugs.

## Next steps for a future session (optional, no known bugs)
- Run the full pytest suite in an environment with network egress
  (`pip install -r requirements.txt && pytest`) to get a live pass/fail
  signal — everything here was validated via static review + py_compile.
- Optional: rate-limiting (e.g. Flask-Limiter) on `/login` and `/register`
  to slow brute-force/enumeration attempts — not previously present and
  not added this session to avoid introducing a new hard dependency
  without being able to test it end-to-end.
- Optional: extend `profile.html` to surface a "Recent XP activity" widget
  using `current_user.xp_logs` (relationship already exists via backref).
- Optional: archive/rate-limit old `XPLog` rows if the table grows large
  in production.

## Prior session history — preserved for reference

### 1. "Mark Incomplete" / reset progress button (DONE)
- `blueprints/main.py`:
  - New `POST /bites/<int:bite_id>/uncomplete` route (`@csrf.exempt`,
    `@login_required`), mirrors `complete_bite`. Sets `Progress.completed =
    False`, clears `completed_at`. Does **not** deduct XP (by design — see
    prior session's plan).
  - `XPLog` import added.
- `templates/bite_detail.html` — added `#uncompleteBtn` (`btn btn-ghost
  btn-sm`) next to `#completeBtn`, hidden via inline `style="display:none;"`
  when `not is_completed`.
- `static/js/bite.js` — wired `uncompleteBtn` click handler using the
  existing `postForm()` helper from `main.js`. On success it hides itself,
  re-enables `completeBtn` and resets its label/classes back to the
  "not completed" state. `completeBtn`'s success handler now also reveals
  `uncompleteBtn`.

### 2. XP history log (DONE)
- `models.py` — new `XPLog` model: `id, user_id (FK->users), amount, reason,
  created_at`, relationship `User.xp_logs` (backref, cascade delete), index
  `ix_xp_log_user_id` on `user_id`.
- `schema.sql` — mirrored `xp_log` table + index for raw-SQL provisioning.
- `blueprints/main.py` — `XPLog` rows inserted in both award sites:
  - `complete_bite()` — on first completion only (`reason="bite_complete"`).
  - `submit_quiz()` — once per correct answer (`reason="quiz_correct"`).
- `blueprints/admin.py` — new paginated `GET /admin/xp-log` route
  (`manage_xp_log`, 20/page, same pattern as `manage_payments`).
- `templates/admin/xp_log.html` — new template, table + pagination,
  copied structure from `admin/payments.html`.
- `templates/admin/base_admin.html` — added "⚡ XP Log" sidebar nav link.
- `tests/test_bites_and_quizzes.py` — added XPLog creation test +
  uncomplete-route tests (login required, resets progress, doesn't refund
  XP, 404 on unknown bite).
- `tests/test_admin.py` — added `TestAdminXPLog` (loads, admin-required,
  shows inserted entries).

### 3. Email validation regex on front-end (DONE)
- `templates/register.html`:
  - Added `pattern="^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$"` + `title` to the email
    `<input>` for native HTML5 validation.
  - Added inline JS (`input`/`blur` listeners) showing a `#emailHint`
    message and red border when the value doesn't match the regex, without
    blocking native browser validation or removing backend checks in
    `blueprints/auth.py` (untouched — still the source of truth).
  - Checked `templates/profile.html` and `templates/login.html` — neither
    has an email `<input>`, so no further client-side changes needed there.

## Completed features overall
Auth, bites, quizzes, gamification (incl. XP history log + admin view),
recommendations, certificates, fake payments, analytics dashboard, admin
panel (with XP log), leaderboard, error pages, full pytest suite, CSRF
protection, admin pagination/search, UI polish, recommendation-engine perf
fixes + DB indexes, expanded README, mark-incomplete UX, client-side email
validation.

## Status
Per the original wishlist in this file, Enhancements #1–#7 are now all
complete. The project is considered feature-complete.

## Next steps for a future session (optional hardening, no known bugs)
- Run the full pytest suite in an environment with `pip install -r
  requirements.txt` (this sandbox session had no network egress, so tests
  were reviewed and added but not executed — they follow the exact patterns
  of pre-existing passing tests in the same files, and `python -m py_compile`
  was run on every touched `.py` file with no errors).
- Optional: extend `profile.html` to surface a "Recent XP activity" widget
  using `current_user.xp_logs` (relationship already exists via backref) —
  not required by the wishlist, but the data model now supports it.
- Optional: rate-limit or archive old `XPLog` rows if the table grows large
  in production — not needed at current scale.

## Prior session history (#2–#6) — preserved for reference

### Enhancement #5: Performance & dedup (COMPLETE)
- `recommend.py`: `recommend_bites()`/`estimate_user_level()` accept an
  optional `completed_ids` to avoid a duplicate query; fixed N+1 in the
  cold-start popularity fallback via one grouped count query.
- `blueprints/main.py` — `dashboard()` passes precomputed `completed_ids`.
- `models.py` — `Bite.category_id` indexed; `QuizAttempt` composite index
  `ix_quiz_attempts_user_bite`.
- `schema.sql` — mirrored both indexes.

### Enhancement #6: README (COMPLETE)
- Added Running Tests, Environment Variables, Architecture Overview
  sections to `README.md`.

### Enhancement #2: CSRF Protection with Flask-WTF (COMPLETE)
- `Flask-WTF` added, `CSRFProtect` wired in `extensions.py`/`app.py`, meta
  tag in `base.html`, hidden tokens in all POST forms, JSON endpoints
  `@csrf.exempt`, `postJSON`/`postForm` send `X-CSRFToken` header.

### Enhancement #3: Admin Pagination + Search (COMPLETE)
- `manage_bites`, `manage_users`, `manage_payments` all paginated/filterable
  with matching template controls.

### Enhancement #4: UI/CSS Polish (COMPLETE)
- Pagination, `.btn-sm`, `.admin-filter-bar`, `.form-control`, extra badge
  colours, fade-in transition, responsive admin breakpoints, focus-visible
  outlines.
