## Validation Performed
- App factory imports and route map verified (Flask app boots cleanly)
- Full seed run executed against a live SQLite DB: 2 users, 6 categories, 11 bites, 11 quiz questions created successfully
- Recommendation engine (`recommend_bites`) executed against seeded data and returned valid personalized results
- Certificate generator (`generate_certificate_pdf`) executed and produced a valid non-empty PDF file

## Remaining Files
None — all items from the requested build order (1–16) have been generated.

## Next Step
None required. Project is runnable as-is following the README setup instructions (MySQL by default; SQLite override demonstrated during testing via `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///app.db`).
